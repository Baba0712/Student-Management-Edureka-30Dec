1. constructor: this event for initialization, do not write haeavy code in this event.
2. ngOnInit: this is the event where we can load the data from backend.
3. ngDoCheck: this will be called after init and after any event is fired.
4. ngOnChanges: Capture the oldValue and newValue on Input properties. Should not be 
implemented with ngDoCheck.
5. ngAfterViewInit: To access the components after they are initalized inside your parent component.
6. ngAfterContentInit: to access the contents within componets once they are initialized.
7. ngOnDestroy : this is last event in component lifecycle, and we can use this to release memory by destroying objects.
or we can use this for special scenarios where user has unsaved changes on view and tries to navigate to another view.
