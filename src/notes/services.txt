What is a service:

1. Re-usable code.
2. Business rules
3. to share the data.


Types of service:
1. Class based service
2. Non-class based service
a. Value Provider -- http
b. Factory -- Routing

Class-based service:
1. create a service
2. register the service
3. inject the service

DI: 
Dependency Injection: Angular has DI already built-in, we can use consturctor injection.

Singleton Vs Non-Singleton:

only one instance of service will be available for entire service.

1. When we register a service using module the service is singleton.
2.  we can register the service with component, so it won't be available for 
other component,but it will be available for its child component.


Value Provider:
When we need some constants to be used as a service.

Factory:
